TODO:
	* getnodes should not only recreate 'green' but also add any new dir in
	  data_raw, as well as create new config files such as silk.conf and
	  sensor.conf for the new IPs.  Somehow integrate create_silkconf.py with
	  getnodes.py
	* The global loop wait 10 seconds before respawning another download.
	  Does this check to see if there is already a pending DL occurring?
	  No.
	  Need to add a 'pending' variable for all currntly running threads.
	  When the thread completes, it can delete it's entry in this structure.
	* need a way of knowing whether data has been imported into the db from
	  the _raw directory.  Otherwise, when the process restarts, it will have
	  to re-import everything again; which can take ~10 hours for 193 GB.

	  I'm thinking a pickle of all the files for a specific host, but not sure
	  how to 'age' the files appropriately to know whether to bother importing
	  them again.
